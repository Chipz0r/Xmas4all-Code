Xmas4all.co.uk Code
==================

Full project details can be found at http://www.xmas4all.co.uk

Based on a project by drcurzon at instructables

http://www.instructables.com/id/Web-Control-of-Raspberry-Pi-GPIO/

Table improvments by my good friend Edwin J

Improved for use with Raspberry Pi B+ with 16 gpio.

The setup for this is exactly as the original project on instructables .

gpio.sql now holds all data for 16 gpio pins .

light.php is a cut down version of the original control.php .

The original control.php can still be used to edit the pin names etc , but is way too big for my use .

Pins and buttons now can be in multiple coloums by changing this value in light.php $numCols = 2;
